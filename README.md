# top-calculator
An in-browser calculator for performing basic mathematical calculations, modelled on the iPhone calculator app. This project was developed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course capstone project - check out my [live version](https://silverwish.github.io/top-calculator/).

## new things I've learned
- the basics of object manipulation and an appreciation of the power of object-oriented programming
- how using appropriate switch case statements can benefit code readability
- developed my confidence in using basic string manipulation methods

## biggest challenges
- implementing the logic to make the calculator functional
- expanding existing functions to ensure most use cases (e.g. switching an operator to correct a mistake or double clicking the % button) do not cause the calculation to break
- accepting "good enough" and avoiding perfectionism in trying to cover all possible use cases of a basic calculator
- trying to abide by the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

## technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
